## Background
This repository contains a software prototype and training codes used to assess degenerative features of osteochondral samples.
Samples should be imaged with micro-computed tomography using Phosphotungstic acid stain. 
Detailed describtion for imaging and grading procedure can be found from [our previous paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joca.2017.05.021):

The texture analysis methods used for feature extraction are implemented using our [LocalBinaryPattern](https://github.com/MIPT-Oulu/LocalBinaryPattern) repository.

More about the analysis procedure implemented in this repository can be found in [the article published on Osteoarthritis and Cartilage.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joca.2020.05.002)

 
## Prerequisites
* To avoid memory issues, the software runs on 64-bit systems only. 
* Until installer file is released, software has to be executed through MS Visual Studio. However, the compiled application can be provided upon request.


## Installation
* Currently, software can be used by opening 3DHistoGrading.sln on MS Visual Studio, compiling and running the project.
* We are planning to create an installer file that allows installing the software without additional dependencies.

## Application usage
Currently available features:
* Visualize 3D image datasets (.png, .tiff, .bmp) using 3D rendering and three orthogonal planes
* Load Mask on top of visualized dataset (mask should be registered with the dataset)
* Surface artefact cropping tool for coronal and sagittal plane
* Automatic sample alignment
* Automatic segmentation of bone-cartilage -interface using CNTK (Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit)
* Automatic bone (calcified tissues) and articular cartilage segmentation
* Automatic extraction of different volumes-of-interest (surface cartilage, deep cartilage and calcified tissue)
* Automatic grading from different osteochondral zones

## Outputs
* Result of degeneration detection (logistic regression) and corresponding ÂµCT grade (ridge regression) from analysed sample volumes-of-interest
* Extracted analysis volumes can be saved as separate datasets
* Automatically segmented calcified tissue mask can be saved
* Sample data with performed processing steps
